This project implements a tool for LLM-based authoring and orchestration of conversational tutoring workflows. This happens in two steps: First, the system generates a tutoring script consisting of a series of guiding questions, each with discussion points aligned to the learning objectives automatically from existing lesson texts. These scripts can then be edited by instructional designers to meet their specific needs. Second, the system orchestrates the script via two conversational agents in a free-form dialog in a learning-by-teaching format. The human learner engages with these agents, teaching Ruffle (student agent) with support from Riley (professor agent). This repository is published alongside the paper [*Ruffle&Riley: Insights from Designing and Evaluating a LLM-Based Conversational Tutoring System*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-64302-6_6).

## :pencil: Adding New Lessons

The system can be easily extended with new lessons across various subjects. Adding a new lesson involves setting up a *lesson page* and a corresponding *tutoring script*. The lesson page is a html document that defines the material the user can navigate during the learning activity. The tutoring script defines the questions and associated discussion points the user needs to teach the student agent. To make the set-up process as easy as possible please start by adapting the example lesson:

**Set up the lesson page:**
* Lesson page definition: Adapt the lesson page specification for the new lesson: ``./src/components/content/eukaryoticCells.js``
* Configure agents: Copy the raw lesson text into the variable ``eukaryoticCellText`` in the file ``./src/components/content/eukaryoticCellText.js``. This allows the LLM-based agents to keep the conversational learning activity within the scope of the lesson.

**Set up the tutoring script:**

* Tutoring script generation: We illustrate the automated script generation process in a notebook (``./notebooks/question_generation.ipynb``). Copy the raw lesson text into the variable ``LESSON_TEXT`` and run the full notebook. The last code block will output the final tutoring script. 
* Configure agents: Copy the raw tutoring scrip text into the variable ``eukaryoticCellText`` in the file ``./src/components/content/eukaryoticCellText``.
